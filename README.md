student database

Users can traverse the pages with the top navigation bar

Add function:
User is able to add a student to the database with inputs for name, height, weight, gpa, email, and favourite colour.
User cannot enter inputs for height smaller than 36 inches (3 feet) or larger than 96 inches (8 feet), as these are likely unrealistic measurements for a student and would overload the display page.
User also cannot enter inputs for weight smaller than 30 pounds or larger than 400 pounds, as these are also likely unrealistic measurements for a student and would overload the display page.
GPA cannot be an input less than 0.0 or greater that 4.0.
Email must include a '.com' or '.ca' and an @ symbol.


Display Function:
Acts as the 'home' page for the web app.
Students in database are displayed in boxes proportionate to their listed weights and heights.
Student names are in the colour of their listed favourite colour.
Clicking on a student's name will open up the individual page for that student, with their full details listed out.
From the students individual page, you are also given the option to remove the student from the database or edit their details.

Edit Function:
Behaves exactly like Add function and updates student info based on inputs.

Error Page:
If inputs in add or edit functions are not valid, an error page will appear with relevant info about the errors of the attempted inputs
